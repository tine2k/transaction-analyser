## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The table shows the exact sum of visible transaction amounts

The system SHALL display a sum for the transaction rows currently shown after applying the active filters. The sum SHALL be the signed arithmetic total of those rows' returned decimal amounts, SHALL be computed with exact decimal arithmetic without floating-point rounding, and SHALL change when the visible rows change. The system SHALL present the sum using the browser's active locale's EUR currency and number conventions, including locale-appropriate thousands grouping and currency placement, while preserving the exact decimal value without rounding it. The sum SHALL be presented separately from the transaction columns and SHALL NOT alter or imply a stored transaction value. When no row is visible, the sum SHALL be zero, presented as a locale-formatted euro zero.

#### Scenario: The sum reflects only visible rows

- **WHEN** visible rows have amounts `-12.50` and `4.00` while another filtered-out row has amount `100.00`
- **THEN** the displayed sum is the locale-formatted euro value of `-8.50`

#### Scenario: The sum preserves exact decimal values

- **WHEN** visible rows have amounts `0.01` and `-0.02`
- **THEN** the displayed sum is the locale-formatted euro value of `-0.01`, without floating-point approximation or rounding

#### Scenario: The sum follows locale currency conventions

- **WHEN** the visible rows have a sum large enough to be grouped under the active locale
- **THEN** the displayed sum uses that locale's EUR currency and number conventions, including thousands grouping, and its sign remains readable

#### Scenario: No visible transactions have a zero sum

- **WHEN** the active filters match no transaction
- **THEN** the table's displayed sum is a locale-formatted euro zero
